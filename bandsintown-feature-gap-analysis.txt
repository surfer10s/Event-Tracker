BANDSINTOWN vs EVENT TRACKER — COMPLETE FEATURE GAP ANALYSIS
================================================================================
Generated: 2026-02-21

This document lists every identified feature that Bandsintown offers which the
event-tracker-backend does NOT currently have. Features already implemented
(favorites, notifications, YouTube integration, tour maps, setlists, concert
history, email digests, artist search, affiliate links, etc.) are excluded.

Effort estimates:
  S  = Small   (1-2 days, single file/route changes)
  M  = Medium  (3-5 days, new model + routes + frontend page)
  L  = Large   (1-2 weeks, multiple services, external APIs, significant UI)
  XL = Extra Large (2+ weeks, major infrastructure or third-party integration)

Impact ratings (user experience & engagement):
  ***   = Critical  — Directly drives retention, daily usage, or core value
  **    = High      — Noticeably improves experience; users would miss it
  *     = Moderate  — Nice-to-have; improves polish but not a dealbreaker
  -     = Low       — Niche or only relevant at scale

================================================================================
SECTION 1: EVENT ENGAGEMENT & ATTENDANCE
================================================================================

1. RSVP / "I'M GOING" SYSTEM
   Bandsintown lets users RSVP to future events, marking intent to attend.
   This is distinct from concert history (which logs past attendance).
   Would need: new RSVP model (userId, eventId, status, createdAt), routes
   for RSVP/un-RSVP, count display on event cards, and a "My Upcoming
   Events" view filtered to RSVPed events.
   Effort: M
   Impact: *** — Foundation feature. Unlocks calendar sync, reminders, social
   proof, and post-event prompts. Transforms the app from "browse events" to
   "plan my concert life." Users who RSVP have a reason to come back.

2. PRE-EVENT REMINDERS (1 MONTH, 1 WEEK, 1 DAY BEFORE)
   Automated reminder notifications sent at intervals before an RSVPed
   event. Bandsintown sends at 1 month and 1 week. Would require a
   scheduled job that queries RSVPs with upcoming dates and triggers
   email/in-app notifications.
   Depends on: #1 (RSVP system)
   Effort: M
   Impact: *** — Keeps users engaged between booking and attending. Prevents
   forgotten shows. The reminder itself brings users back to the app and
   creates a touchpoint that feels genuinely helpful, not spammy.

3. POST-EVENT PROMPT TO RATE
   After an RSVPed event's date passes, prompt the user to log it to
   concert history with a rating. Bandsintown does this to drive
   engagement. Could be a scheduled job or a banner on next login.
   Depends on: #1 (RSVP system)
   Effort: S
   Impact: ** — Closes the loop on the concert experience. Drives concert
   history usage and makes the rating/review feature feel alive. Low effort
   for meaningful engagement lift.

4. CALENDAR SYNC (ICAL / GOOGLE CALENDAR)
   Export RSVPed events as an .ics feed URL that auto-syncs with Google
   Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook. Generate a per-user iCal feed
   endpoint (e.g., GET /api/v1/users/calendar.ics) that returns all
   upcoming RSVPed events in iCalendar format.
   Depends on: #1 (RSVP system)
   Effort: S (ical-generator npm package exists)
   Impact: *** — Integrates your app into the user's daily workflow. Once
   concerts appear in their calendar, your app becomes indispensable. One of
   the highest value-to-effort ratios on this list.

5. RSVP COUNTS ON EVENTS
   Show how many users have RSVPed to each event ("42 people going").
   Creates social proof and urgency. Simple aggregation query on the
   RSVP collection.
   Depends on: #1 (RSVP system)
   Effort: S
   Impact: * — Social proof is powerful at scale but requires a meaningful
   user base to feel authentic. With a small user count, showing "2 people
   going" could backfire. Best to implement but hide until counts are
   meaningful, or supplement with external data.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: TICKET & SALES ALERTS
================================================================================

6. ON-SALE DATE ALERTS
   Notify users when tickets go on sale for events they're tracking.
   The Event model already stores tickets.onSaleDate. Needs a scheduled
   job that finds events where onSaleDate is today/tomorrow and sends
   notifications to users who follow that artist.
   Effort: M
   Impact: *** — This is the moment users care about most. Missing an on-sale
   means missing good seats or paying resale prices. Delivering this alert
   reliably builds trust and makes the app essential to the ticket-buying
   workflow.

7. PRESALE ALERTS WITH ACCESS CODES
   Notify users about presale windows before general on-sale. The Event
   model already has tickets.presales array with startDate, endDate, and
   name. A scheduled job could notify users of upcoming presales. Code
   distribution would require an additional data source.
   Effort: M
   Impact: *** — Presale access is a premium perk that makes users feel like
   insiders. Even without codes, knowing a presale exists and when it starts
   gives users a competitive advantage. Strong differentiator.

8. SOLD-OUT DETECTION & NOTIFICATIONS
   Monitor ticket status changes. When an event's tickets.status changes
   to "sold_out" or "limited", notify RSVPed/tracking users. Requires
   periodic status polling from Ticketmaster/SeatGeek APIs and a diff
   check against stored status.
   Effort: M
   Impact: ** — Creates urgency and helps users act before it's too late.
   "Limited tickets remaining" is a powerful motivator. Also enables the
   waitlist feature (#9).

9. WAITLIST FOR SOLD-OUT EVENTS
   Let users join a waitlist for sold-out events. Notify them if the
   status changes back to available. Simple model (userId, eventId,
   createdAt) plus a check in the sold-out detection job (#8).
   Depends on: #8 (sold-out detection)
   Effort: S
   Impact: ** — Gives users hope and a reason to stay engaged even after
   missing out. When tickets do become available, the notification feels
   like a gift. Builds loyalty.

10. PRICE DROP ALERTS
    Notify users when ticket prices decrease for events they're tracking.
    Requires storing price history (snapshots over time) and comparing
    against previous values during sync. The notification model already
    has a 'price_drop' type defined but no implementation exists.
    Effort: M
    Impact: ** — Saves users money and builds trust. People love feeling like
    they got a deal. However, price drops are infrequent for most events so
    the notification won't fire often. Still worth it for the goodwill.

================================================================================
SECTION 3: DISCOVERY & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

11. PERSONALIZED DISCOVERY FEED
    A homepage feed showing "Artists like yours, touring near you." Cross-
    reference Last.fm similar artists (already integrated) with events in
    the database near the user's location. Display as a discovery section
    on the dashboard.
    Effort: M
    Impact: *** — The single best way to help users discover new concerts
    they'll love. Leverages data you already have (favorites + Last.fm +
    location) to create a "magic" experience. This is what turns casual
    users into power users.

12. TRENDING ARTISTS CHART
    Rank artists by recent fan activity (new followers, RSVPs, event
    announcements). Bandsintown publishes a "Trending Touring Artists"
    chart. Could be built from your data: artists gaining the most new
    favorites, most RSVPs, or most new events in the past week.
    Effort: M
    Impact: * — Fun content but requires a large user base to generate
    meaningful trends. At small scale, the data won't be interesting. Better
    to defer until you have enough users to make rankings meaningful.

13. "HOT SHOWS" / CURATED PICKS
    Highlight popular upcoming events based on RSVP count, ticket sales
    velocity, or admin curation. A "Hot This Week" section on the
    dashboard. Could be algorithmic (highest RSVP count) or manually
    curated by admin.
    Effort: S-M
    Impact: ** — Gives new and casual users something to browse even before
    they've built up favorites. Admin-curated picks work at any scale and
    add an editorial voice to the platform.

14. FESTIVAL DISCOVERY & LINEUP TRACKING
    Dedicated festival listings with full lineup display. Each festival
    would be a parent event with child events per artist set. Needs a
    Festival model (or a flag on Event) and a lineup association. Users
    could track festivals and see which of their favorite artists are
    playing.
    Effort: L
    Impact: ** — Festivals are a huge part of the live music experience and
    currently a blind spot. "3 of your favorites are playing Bonnaroo" is a
    compelling notification. Seasonal impact (festival season is spring/summer).

15. FESTIVAL SET TIMES
    Display set times within festival lineups. Requires time slot data
    per artist within a festival. Depends on festival data source
    availability.
    Depends on: #14 (festival discovery)
    Effort: S
    Impact: * — Useful for festival attendees but narrow audience. Only
    matters if festival tracking (#14) is implemented first. Nice polish
    but not a driver of new engagement.

16. "JUST ANNOUNCED" FEED
    A chronological feed of newly added events for followed artists.
    Different from notifications — this is a browsable activity stream.
    Query events created in the last 7 days for the user's favorite +
    music taste artists, sorted by createdAt.
    Effort: S
    Impact: ** — Gives users a reason to check the app daily. "What's new"
    is a natural browsing behavior. Low effort since the data already exists
    — just needs a view. Complements notifications with a pull-based
    alternative.

17. SIMILAR ARTIST AUTO-FOLLOW SUGGESTIONS
    After a user follows an artist, suggest similar artists to also
    follow. Use the existing Last.fm similar artists endpoint. Display
    as a "You might also like" prompt after adding a favorite.
    Effort: S
    Impact: ** — Accelerates the onboarding flywheel. More favorites = more
    relevant notifications = more value. Catches users in a moment of high
    engagement (they just followed someone) and deepens it. Easy win.

18. MUSIC DNA PROFILE VISUALIZATION
    A visual representation of the user's music taste — genre breakdown,
    top artists, diversity score. Built from favorites + music taste
    data. Could be a radar chart or genre distribution pie chart on the
    profile page.
    Effort: M
    Impact: * — Fun and shareable but doesn't drive core engagement. Users
    look at it once, share it, and move on. Good for viral growth if paired
    with sharing (#19-20) but low repeat usage.

================================================================================
SECTION 4: SOCIAL FEATURES
================================================================================

19. EVENT SHARING WITH OPEN GRAPH TAGS
    Generate shareable event links with proper Open Graph meta tags so
    they preview nicely on social media (Facebook, Twitter, iMessage).
    Requires a server-rendered event page or a dynamic OG tag endpoint.
    Effort: S-M
    Impact: ** — Shared links that look professional (with event image, date,
    venue) drive organic traffic. Every share is free marketing. Without OG
    tags, shared links show a blank preview which kills click-through.

20. SHARE TO SOCIAL MEDIA BUTTONS
    Add share buttons (Twitter/X, Facebook, copy link) to event detail
    pages. Construct share URLs with pre-filled text. Pure frontend
    change with share intent URLs.
    Effort: S
    Impact: ** — Removes friction from sharing. Users who want to tell
    friends about a concert will do it more if there's a one-click button.
    Best paired with #19 (OG tags) so the shared links look good.

21. "REQUEST A SHOW" / DEMAND TRACKING
    Let users click "I want to see [Artist] in [City]." Store demand
    votes (userId, artistId, city, state). Surface aggregated demand:
    "47 fans in Nashville want to see Artist X." Lightweight model +
    single route + frontend button.
    Effort: M
    Impact: ** — Keeps users engaged with artists who aren't currently
    touring. Provides a call-to-action on otherwise empty artist pages.
    The aggregated data is interesting content in itself ("most requested
    artists in your city").

22. FRIEND SYSTEM / SOCIAL CONNECTIONS
    Connect with other users to see their RSVPs and favorites. See which
    friends are going to the same events. Requires a friendship model
    (request/accept flow), privacy settings, and a friends activity feed.
    Effort: L
    Impact: ** — Social features create network effects and make the app
    stickier. "Your friend Sarah is going to this show" is compelling. But
    requires critical mass of users to be valuable. Defer until user base
    is large enough that people actually know each other on the platform.

23. ATTENDEE LIST / "WHO'S GOING"
    Show which users (or friends) have RSVPed to an event. Privacy-
    controlled — users opt in to being visible. Queries RSVP collection
    filtered by event.
    Depends on: #1 (RSVP system)
    Effort: S-M
    Impact: * — Same scale concern as #5 and #22. Interesting in theory but
    needs enough users attending the same events to be useful. Privacy
    implications require careful design.

================================================================================
SECTION 5: NOTIFICATION ENHANCEMENTS
================================================================================

24. PUSH NOTIFICATIONS (WEB)
    Browser push notifications using the Web Push API (service workers).
    Currently only email and in-app. Web push would deliver real-time
    alerts even when the user isn't on the site. Requires service worker
    registration, VAPID keys, and a push subscription model.
    Effort: L
    Impact: *** — Dramatically increases notification visibility. Email open
    rates are ~20%; push notification tap rates are 2-5x higher. Users who
    opt into push are significantly more engaged. This is how you compete
    with native apps without building one.

25. SMS NOTIFICATIONS (FULL IMPLEMENTATION)
    Infrastructure exists (smsOptIn field, mobile number storage) but
    no SMS sending is implemented. Integrate Twilio or similar to send
    text alerts for high-priority notifications (on-sale, presale,
    events for favorites).
    Effort: M
    Impact: ** — SMS has the highest open rate of any channel (~98%). Best
    reserved for high-value, time-sensitive alerts (presale starting in 1
    hour, last tickets available). Overuse will cause unsubscribes. Cost
    per message (~$0.01) is a factor at scale.

26. MULTI-LOCATION NOTIFICATIONS
    Currently users get notifications for one location only. Allow saving
    multiple cities (home, work, travel destinations) and receiving
    notifications for events near any of them.
    Effort: M
    Impact: ** — Common user complaint on Bandsintown reviews. People travel
    for work, visit family, go on vacation — they want to catch shows in
    all those places. Solves a real pain point for active concert-goers.

27. CONFIGURABLE NOTIFICATION RADIUS
    Let users adjust their notification radius beyond the fixed 50 miles.
    Bandsintown allows up to 150 miles. Add a notificationRadius field
    to the User model and use it in the notification service distance
    checks.
    Effort: S
    Impact: ** — Rural users may need 100+ miles; city users may want 25.
    One-size-fits-all frustrates both groups. Tiny change that immediately
    makes the app feel more personalized and reduces irrelevant
    notifications (or surfaces missed ones).

28. NOTIFICATION FOR ANY NEW SHOW (NOT JUST NEARBY)
    Option to be notified about ALL new events for a followed artist,
    regardless of distance. Useful for fans willing to travel. A toggle
    per artist or global setting.
    Effort: S
    Impact: ** — Die-hard fans will travel anywhere for their top artists.
    This lets them know about every opportunity. Per-artist toggle is ideal:
    "notify me everywhere" for top 3 favorites, nearby-only for the rest.

29. GRANULAR NOTIFICATION PREFERENCES
    Per-category notification controls: toggle on/off for new events,
    on-sale alerts, presales, price drops, reminders. Currently it's
    all-or-nothing. Needs a notification preferences sub-document on
    the User model.
    Effort: M
    Impact: * — Important for preventing notification fatigue but only
    matters once you have multiple notification types (#6, #7, #8, #10).
    Build this when users start complaining about too many notifications
    — a good problem to have.

30. NOTIFICATION DIGEST FREQUENCY OPTIONS
    Let users choose digest frequency: real-time, daily, weekly, or
    off. Currently only daily digest exists. Add a digestFrequency
    field and adjust the digest scheduler accordingly.
    Effort: S-M
    Impact: * — Useful preference but not a game-changer. Some users want
    weekly summaries, others want immediate alerts. Nice customization
    but low urgency. Weekly digest option is most impactful since it
    reduces email fatigue for casual users.

================================================================================
SECTION 6: ADDITIONAL MUSIC SERVICE INTEGRATIONS
================================================================================

31. SPOTIFY INTEGRATION (ARTIST IMPORT)
    Import followed artists and top artists from Spotify. Spotify's API
    provides /me/following and /me/top/artists endpoints. OAuth flow
    similar to existing YouTube integration. Would significantly expand
    the music taste data.
    Effort: L
    Impact: *** — Spotify is the dominant music platform. Many users who
    don't use YouTube Music heavily have rich Spotify data. This single
    integration could double the number of artists the app can track per
    user, making notifications and discovery dramatically better.

32. APPLE MUSIC INTEGRATION
    Import library artists from Apple Music using MusicKit JS or the
    Apple Music API. More complex than Spotify due to Apple's auth
    requirements (developer token + user token).
    Effort: L
    Impact: ** — Important for iOS-heavy user bases. Apple Music has ~25%
    of the streaming market. Worth doing after Spotify but lower priority
    since the API is harder to work with and the audience is smaller.

33. LAST.FM SCROBBLE IMPORT
    Import top artists from a user's Last.fm listening history. The
    Last.fm API is already integrated for similar artists — extending
    to user.getTopArtists would pull real listening data. Requires
    Last.fm username linking (no OAuth needed, just username).
    Effort: S-M
    Impact: * — Niche audience (Last.fm is much smaller than Spotify/Apple
    Music) but extremely easy to implement since the API is already
    integrated. The data quality is excellent — scrobble counts give
    precise listening frequency. Good quick add for power users.

34. SHAZAM HISTORY IMPORT
    Import Shazamed songs/artists. Shazam doesn't have a public API,
    but Apple Music integration could surface Shazam data indirectly
    through the Apple Music library.
    Depends on: #32 (Apple Music integration)
    Effort: L
    Impact: * — Interesting signal (Shazaming = discovering new music) but
    indirect access via Apple Music makes this low priority. The data
    volume is small compared to a streaming library.

================================================================================
SECTION 7: ARTIST-SIDE FEATURES
================================================================================

Note: These features target artists as users of the platform. They represent a
significant product expansion and may not align with the current user-focused
scope. Included for completeness.

35. ARTIST CLAIM / VERIFICATION SYSTEM
    Let artists claim their profile page and get a verified badge. Verify
    via linked social media accounts or manual review. Adds credibility
    to artist pages.
    Effort: M
    Impact: * — Only matters if you're targeting artists as users, which is
    a different product direction. Adds trust signals to profiles but
    doesn't directly improve the fan experience unless artists contribute
    content (#38).

36. ARTIST SELF-SERVICE EVENT MANAGEMENT
    Let verified artists add/edit their own events directly, rather than
    relying solely on Ticketmaster sync. Useful for independent artists
    not on major ticketing platforms.
    Depends on: #35 (artist verification)
    Effort: L
    Impact: ** — Expands event coverage beyond Ticketmaster's catalog.
    Independent and local artists often aren't on major platforms but have
    passionate fans. Would unlock a segment of live music currently
    invisible to your users.

37. ARTIST ANALYTICS DASHBOARD
    Show verified artists their follower count, follower locations,
    RSVP counts by city, and demand data. Built from existing user
    data aggregations.
    Depends on: #35 (artist verification)
    Effort: L
    Impact: - — Only relevant to artists, not fans. Useful for attracting
    artists to the platform but doesn't improve the fan experience.
    Defer until artist-side features are a strategic priority.

38. ARTIST-TO-FAN POSTS / MESSAGING
    Let verified artists send messages/updates to their followers.
    Creates a direct communication channel. Needs a Post model, delivery
    via in-app + email, and an inbox UI for fans.
    Depends on: #35 (artist verification)
    Effort: L
    Impact: ** — Exclusive content from artists is a strong retention
    driver. Fans love feeling connected. But requires artists to actively
    use the platform, which is a chicken-and-egg problem at small scale.

39. GEO-TARGETED ARTIST POSTS
    Artists can target messages to fans in specific cities/regions. E.g.,
    "Hey Nashville fans, presale code is ROCK2026." Extension of the
    post system with location filtering.
    Depends on: #38 (artist posts)
    Effort: M
    Impact: * — Enhancement to artist posts (#38). Only relevant if
    the artist posting system is active and well-adopted. Adds precision
    but not a standalone feature.

40. EMBEDDABLE EVENT WIDGET
    A JavaScript widget that artists/venues can embed on their website
    to show upcoming events. Served from your domain, pulls data via API.
    Good for distribution and backlinks.
    Effort: M
    Impact: * — Growth tool rather than user experience feature. Drives
    traffic from artist/venue websites back to your platform. Valuable for
    SEO and user acquisition but doesn't improve the core product.

41. ARTIST "TRACK" BUTTON EMBED
    An embeddable button artists place on their website that lets fans
    follow them on your platform directly. Increases user acquisition.
    Effort: S
    Impact: * — User acquisition tool. Each button is a distribution point
    for your platform. Low effort but requires artist adoption to be
    effective. Best paired with artist-side features (#35-38).

================================================================================
SECTION 8: VENUE FEATURES
================================================================================

42. VENUE PROFILES
    Dedicated pages for venues showing: upcoming events, venue details
    (capacity, address, photos), past events. The Event model already
    stores venue data — this aggregates it into a browsable page.
    Effort: M
    Impact: ** — Many concert-goers are loyal to specific venues. "What's
    coming up at The Ryman?" is a natural question. Venue pages aggregate
    content you already have and create new browsing entry points.

43. VENUE DISCOVERY / "VENUES NEAR ME"
    Browse nearby music venues on a map. Uses existing geospatial
    indexes on Event venues. Aggregate unique venues from events and
    display on a Leaflet map.
    Effort: M
    Impact: * — Interesting browsing feature but most users start from
    artists, not venues. More useful for users new to a city. Leverages
    your existing Leaflet map infrastructure well.

44. VENUE FOLLOWING
    Let users follow venues (not just artists) to get notifications for
    any event at that venue. Useful for fans of a specific local club.
    Needs a Venue model (or extraction from Event), a follow system,
    and notification integration.
    Effort: M-L
    Impact: ** — Fills a real gap. Users with a favorite local venue want
    to know about everything happening there, not just their followed
    artists. "Follow The Bluebird Cafe" catches events that artist-based
    tracking misses entirely.

================================================================================
SECTION 9: CONTENT & MEDIA
================================================================================

45. ARTIST BIO / EXTENDED PROFILES
    Rich artist profile pages with biography, discography highlights,
    social links, and streaming stats. Last.fm already provides bio
    and listener stats. Spotify and MusicBrainz could supplement.
    Artist model has fields for description and links but they're
    mostly unpopulated.
    Effort: M
    Impact: * — Makes artist pages feel more complete and professional.
    Users can learn about unfamiliar artists before deciding to attend.
    Nice polish but not a driver of core engagement or retention.

46. EVENT PHOTOS / USER-GENERATED CONTENT
    Let users upload photos from concerts they attended. Attach to
    concert history entries. Needs file upload (S3 or similar),
    image model, and gallery UI.
    Effort: L
    Impact: ** — Makes concert history feel like a personal scrapbook.
    Photos trigger nostalgia and make users want to keep logging concerts.
    User-generated content also enriches event pages for future attendees.
    Storage costs and moderation are considerations.

47. SETLIST VOTING / CROWD-SOURCED SETLISTS
    Let attendees submit or vote on setlists after a concert. Currently
    setlists come from Setlist.fm only. Could supplement with user
    submissions for events not yet on Setlist.fm.
    Effort: M
    Impact: * — Niche feature for setlist enthusiasts. Setlist.fm already
    covers most major shows. Adds community engagement but small audience.
    Could differentiate for shows Setlist.fm doesn't cover.

48. LIVE CONCERT STREAMING
    Bandsintown PLUS offers livestreamed concerts for $9.99/month. This
    is a major platform investment requiring streaming infrastructure,
    artist partnerships, and payment processing. Not recommended at
    current scale.
    Effort: XL
    Impact: - — Wrong scale for this feature. Requires massive investment
    in infrastructure, content licensing, and artist relationships. Would
    distract from core product. Not recommended.

49. LIVE CHAT DURING STREAMS
    Real-time chat during livestreams. Requires WebSocket infrastructure
    and moderation tools.
    Depends on: #48 (livestreaming)
    Effort: L
    Impact: - — Dependent on livestreaming (#48) which is not recommended.
    Skip entirely.

================================================================================
SECTION 10: COMMERCE & MONETIZATION
================================================================================

50. MERCH INTEGRATION (SHOPIFY)
    Display artist merchandise on their profile page. Bandsintown
    integrates with Shopify to show up to 10 products. Requires
    Shopify API integration or simply linking to artist merch stores.
    Effort: M-L (API integration) or S (just links)
    Impact: * — Revenue opportunity via affiliate merch links. Doesn't
    improve core concert discovery but enriches artist pages. Start
    with simple merch store links (S effort) before considering full
    Shopify integration.

51. IN-APP TICKET PURCHASING
    Buy tickets within the app instead of redirecting to external sites.
    Bandsintown partnered with Ticketmaster for this. Requires deep
    Ticketmaster API integration and likely a business partnership.
    Significantly improves conversion but complex to implement.
    Effort: XL
    Impact: ** — Reduces friction significantly (no redirect, no context
    switch) and improves conversion. But requires a business relationship
    with Ticketmaster that may not be available to smaller platforms.
    Current affiliate links are a reasonable substitute.

52. PROMOTED EVENTS / PAID PLACEMENT
    Let venues or promoters pay to boost event visibility. Requires an
    ad/promotion system, payment processing, and placement logic in
    search results and feeds.
    Effort: XL
    Impact: - — Monetization feature, not user experience. Promoted content
    can actually hurt UX if not done carefully. Only consider once you have
    significant traffic that venues/promoters would pay to reach.

53. AFFILIATE REVENUE DASHBOARD
    Track and display affiliate click revenue from Ticketmaster,
    SeatGeek, and StubHub links. Click tracking exists but there's no
    reporting dashboard. Aggregate clicks by platform, event, and
    time period.
    Effort: M
    Impact: - — Internal/admin tool, not user-facing. Important for
    business operations but zero impact on user experience. Build when
    affiliate revenue is meaningful enough to warrant tracking.

================================================================================
SECTION 11: PLATFORM & DISTRIBUTION
================================================================================

54. PROGRESSIVE WEB APP (PWA)
    Convert the web app to a PWA with offline support, installability,
    and app-like experience. Add a manifest.json, service worker for
    caching, and offline fallback pages.
    Effort: M
    Impact: *** — Bridges the gap between web and native app without
    building a native app. Users can "install" it to their home screen,
    get push notifications, and use it offline. Dramatically improves
    mobile experience at a fraction of native app cost.

55. MOBILE APP (NATIVE OR REACT NATIVE)
    Bandsintown has dedicated iOS and Android apps. A native app enables
    push notifications, background location, and better performance.
    Major undertaking.
    Effort: XL
    Impact: ** — Best possible mobile experience but massive investment.
    PWA (#54) covers 80% of native app benefits at 20% of the cost.
    Only worth considering after PWA is established and user base
    demands native features (background sync, deep OS integration).

56. PUBLIC API / DEVELOPER ACCESS
    Expose a public API for third-party developers to query events and
    artists. Bandsintown has a public API used by many apps and websites.
    Needs API key management, rate limiting, and documentation.
    Effort: L
    Impact: - — Platform/ecosystem play, not user-facing. Only makes
    sense when you have unique data worth exposing. Currently you're
    aggregating from other APIs (Ticketmaster, SeatGeek), so the value
    proposition for developers is limited.

57. CROSS-PLATFORM EVENT DISTRIBUTION
    Syndicate events to Spotify, YouTube, Google, Apple Maps, etc.
    Bandsintown is a data provider to these platforms via partnerships.
    Requires business relationships, not just technical integration.
    Effort: XL (partnership-dependent)
    Impact: - — Requires enterprise-level partnerships that aren't
    available to smaller platforms. Bandsintown's distribution deals took
    years and millions of users to establish. Not actionable currently.

================================================================================
SECTION 12: USER EXPERIENCE & PERSONALIZATION
================================================================================

58. ONBOARDING ARTIST IMPORT FLOW
    On first signup, guide users through connecting music services and
    auto-importing artists they already listen to. Bandsintown scans
    libraries immediately on signup. Currently YouTube connection is
    available but not part of an onboarding flow.
    Effort: M
    Impact: *** — First impressions determine whether users stick around.
    A new user with zero favorites gets zero value. An onboarding flow
    that imports 20+ artists in 30 seconds transforms the empty state
    into a personalized experience immediately. Critical for retention.

59. CONFIGURABLE SEARCH RADIUS
    Let users set their preferred search radius (25, 50, 75, 100, 150
    miles) for event discovery. Currently hardcoded at 50 miles. Simple
    User model field + UI dropdown.
    Effort: S
    Impact: ** — Same rationale as #27. Different users have very different
    travel willingness. A 15-minute fix that immediately personalizes the
    experience. Best bang-for-buck ratio on this entire list.

60. MULTIPLE SAVED LOCATIONS
    Save multiple locations (home, work, vacation spots) and browse
    events near any of them. Currently only one address per user.
    Effort: M
    Impact: ** — Solves a real limitation. Users traveling for work or
    vacation want to browse events in those locations without losing
    their home setting. Practical quality-of-life improvement.

61. DARK MODE
    Theme toggle for dark/light mode. Pure frontend CSS change with a
    preference stored in localStorage or User model.
    Effort: S-M
    Impact: * — Expected feature in modern apps. Won't drive engagement
    but its absence may be noticed. Users who prefer dark mode feel
    strongly about it. Low effort, meets expectations.

62. ANNUAL RECAP / YEAR IN REVIEW
    End-of-year summary: concerts attended, unique artists seen, unique
    venues visited, miles traveled, top genres, most-seen artist. Built
    from concert history data. Engaging and shareable.
    Effort: M
    Impact: ** — Spotify Wrapped proved that annual recaps are massively
    shareable. Each share is organic marketing. Also motivates users to
    log concerts all year to get a better recap. Seasonal effort (build
    once, run annually). Great for virality.

63. USER PROFILE / PUBLIC PAGE
    Optional public profile showing concerts attended, favorite artists,
    and upcoming RSVPs. Opt-in visibility. Bandsintown has public user
    profiles.
    Depends on: #1 (RSVP system)
    Effort: M
    Impact: * — Gives users identity on the platform and enables sharing.
    "Check out my concert profile" drives word-of-mouth. But requires
    enough content (concert history, favorites) to look interesting.
    Better after users have been active for a while.

64. ACCOUNT DATA EXPORT (GDPR)
    Let users export all their data (favorites, history, preferences)
    as JSON or CSV. Good practice for privacy compliance.
    Effort: S
    Impact: * — Builds trust and meets privacy expectations. Users rarely
    use it but its presence signals that you respect their data. May
    become legally required depending on your user base locations.

65. ACCOUNT DELETION SELF-SERVICE
    Let users delete their account and all associated data from settings.
    Currently no self-service deletion exists.
    Effort: S
    Impact: * — Legally expected in many jurisdictions (GDPR, CCPA). Users
    who can't delete their account feel trapped, which breeds distrust.
    Simple to implement, important for compliance and credibility.
