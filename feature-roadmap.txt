    |         | Let users pick 25/50/75/100/150   |        |
    |         | miles. One field on User model,   |        |
    |         | one dropdown in UI. Done in an    |        |
    |         | afternoon, felt by every user.    |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 2  | GAP-27  | Configurable notification radius |   S    |  **
    |         | Same concept for notifications.   |        |
    |         | Ship together with #1. Rural      |        |
    |         | users need 100+ mi, city users    |        |
    |         | want 25.                          |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 3  | GAP-4   | Calendar sync (iCal feed)        |   S    |  ***
    |         | Per-user .ics endpoint. Once      |        |
    |         | concerts are in their calendar,   |        |
    |         | you're embedded in daily life.    |        |
    |         | Works even before RSVP system —   |        |
    |         | can export favorited events.      |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 4  | NEW-30  | Crowd-sourced artist live rating  |   S    |  **
    |         | Aggregate existing concert history|        |
    |         | ratings into a community score on |        |
    |         | artist profiles. "4.3/5 live      |        |
    |         | rating." Answers the #1 question: |        |
    |         | "Are they good live?" Zero new    |        |
    |         | data needed — just aggregation.   |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 5  | NEW-6   | Concert time machine / memories  |   S    |  **
    |         | "On this day 2 years ago, you saw |        |
    |         | Artist X at Venue Y." One query   |        |
    |         | against concert history. Massive  |        |
    |         | emotional payoff. Best delight-   |        |
    |         | per-line-of-code on the roadmap.  |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 6  | NEW-24  | Concert countdown widget         |   S    |  **
    |         | Countdown to next upcoming event  |        |
    |         | on dashboard. Simple date math.   |        |

    |         | Events created in last 7 days for |        |
    |         | followed artists. Gives users a   |        |
    |         | reason to check the app daily.    |        |
    |         | Data already exists.              |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 8  | GAP-17  | Similar artist suggestions       |   S    |  **
    |         | After following an artist, show   |        |
    |         | "You might also like" via Last.fm |        |
    |         | (already integrated). Grows the   |        |
    |         | favorites list = more value from  |        |
    |         | notifications.                    |        |

    |         | is free marketing.                |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 11 | GAP-3   | Post-event rating prompt         |   S    |  **
    |         | After an event date passes, nudge |        |

    |         | feeds live ratings (#4 above).    |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 12 | GAP-65  | Account deletion self-service    |   S    |  *

    |         | as JSON/CSV. Trust signal.        |        |

Phase 1 total: ~13 items, each S effort = roughly 1-2 weeks if done serially,
faster if parallelized. Delivers immediate value across personalization,
engagement, compliance, and discovery.


================================================================================
PHASE 2 — CORE ENGAGEMENT SYSTEM                     ~3-4 weeks | M effort
================================================================================
Why second: These are the foundational features that transform the app from
"browse events" to "plan my concert life." The RSVP system unlocks 5+ future
features. Onboarding determines whether new users ever come back.

 #  | Source  | Feature                          | Effort | Impact
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 14 | GAP-1   | RSVP / "I'm Going" system       |   M    |  ***
    |         | THE foundation feature. Unlocks   |        |
    |         | reminders, calendar sync depth,   |        |
    |         | social proof, post-event prompts, |        |
    |         | calendar gap recs, and more. Build|        |
    |         | this before anything else in P2.  |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 15 | GAP-58  | Onboarding artist import flow    |   M    |  ***
    |         | Guide new users to connect YouTube|        |
    |         | (+ Spotify later) and import      |        |
    |         | artists on first login. A new user|        |
    |         | with 0 favorites = 0 value. This  |        |
    |         | fixes the empty-state problem.    |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 16 | GAP-6   | On-sale date alerts              |   M    |  ***
    |         | "Tickets go on sale tomorrow for  |        |
    |         | Artist X!" Data already exists in |        |
    |         | Event model. This is the single   |        |
    |         | most important notification type  |        |
    |         | for concert fans.                 |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 17 | GAP-7   | Presale alerts                   |   M    |  ***
    |         | "Presale starts in 2 hours."      |        |
    |         | Makes users feel like VIPs with   |        |
    |         | early access. Presale data already|        |
    |         | exists in the Event model.        |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 18 | GAP-2   | Pre-event reminders              |   M    |  ***
    |         | 1 month, 1 week, 1 day before     |        |
    |         | RSVPed events. Keeps users engaged|        |
    |         | between booking and attending.    |        |
    |         | Depends on: #14 (RSVP system).    |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 19 | GAP-11  | Personalized discovery feed      |   M    |  ***
    |         | "Artists like yours, touring near |        |
    |         | you." Cross-reference Last.fm     |        |
    |         | similar artists with local events.|        |
    |         | The moment the app feels magical. |        |

Phase 2 total: 6 features, all M effort. This is the most impactful phase.
After this, the app has: RSVPs, reminders, ticket alerts, discovery, and
smooth onboarding.


================================================================================
PHASE 3 — DIFFERENTIATORS (NOVEL)                    ~3-4 weeks | M effort
================================================================================
Why third: These are features NO competitor has. They create word-of-mouth,
make the app feel uniquely intelligent, and give users reasons to recommend
it to friends. All leverage data you already collect.

 #  | Source  | Feature                          | Effort | Impact

    |         | Built from Setlist.fm data you    |        |
    |         | already have. No competitor does  |        |
    |         | this. Users check obsessively as  |        |
    |         | their show approaches. Shareable. |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 21 | NEW-8   | Post-show recap card             |   M    |  ***

    |         | card: artist, venue, setlist,     |        |
    |         | rating, personal stats. Designed  |        |
    |         | for Instagram/Twitter. Every      |        |
    |         | share = branded organic marketing.|        |
    |         | Spotify Wrapped, per concert.     |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 22 | NEW-18  | Smart event scoring              |   M    |  ***
    |         | Personal 1-100 match score per    |        |
    |         | event. Factors: taste match,      |        |
    |         | distance, price, day of week.     |        |
    |         | Cuts through information overload.|        |
    |         | "94% match" instantly answers     |        |
    |         | "should I go?"                    |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 23 | NEW-13  | "Surprise Me" concert finder     |   M    |  ***
    |         | "I'm free Saturday, budget $50."  |        |
    |         | Constraint-based discovery. No    |        |
    |         | concert app does this. Perfect    |        |
    |         | for spontaneous decisions and     |        |
    |         | date-night planning.              |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 24 | NEW-27  | Calendar gap recommendations     |   M    |  ***
    |         | "Nothing planned for March. Here  |        |
    |         | are 5 matches near you." Proactive|        |
    |         | and personalized. Drives ticket   |        |
    |         | purchases directly. Requires RSVP |        |
    |         | system (#14) for calendar data.   |        |

Phase 3 total: 5 features, all M effort, all *** impact. These are what
make users say "this app is different." Highest concentration of novel value
on the entire roadmap.

PHASE 4 — TICKET INTELLIGENCE                        ~2-3 weeks | S-M effort

    |         | big loyalty builder.              |        |
    |         | Depends on: #25 (sold-out detect).|        |

    |         | type — just needs implementation. |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 28 | NEW-4   | "You Missed This" FOMO alerts    |  S-M   |  **

    |         | played 25 mi from you last week." |        |
    |         | Drives users to add more favorites|        |
    |         | and enable notifications. Use     |        |
    |         | sparingly (once per artist max).  |        |
----+---------+----------------------------------+--------+-------
 29 | NEW-25  | "Deep Cuts" alert                |  S-M   |  **

PHASE 5 — PLATFORM & REACH                           ~4-6 weeks | M-L effort
================================================================================
Why fifth: Expands HOW users interact with the app (mobile, push, Spotify)
and WHO can benefit from it (non-YouTube-Music users). These are larger
investments that multiply the value of everything built in Phases 1-4.

Phases 1-3 (7-10 weeks) deliver the highest impact and should be the
immediate focus. After Phase 3, the app will have:
  - Personalized radius, calendar sync, live ratings, memories, countdowns
  - RSVP system, on-sale/presale alerts, reminders, discovery feed
  - Setlist predictions, recap cards, smart scoring, surprise finder
  - Smooth onboarding that converts new users immediately

That combination doesn't exist in any competitor. Ship it.
